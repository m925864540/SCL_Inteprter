# SCL_Interpreter

This is a project for the CS4308 Concepts of Programming Language class. The project is done by a three person group.
The group memeber are: Mike Lin, Brandon Tedeschi, and Nick Tibbetts.

The CS4308 project consists of the development of an interpreter for a subset of the SCL language. The interpreter can be implemented in any of the following programming languages: C,C++,Java, Python, or Ada.

This project consists of developing a complete language processor (interpreter ) for a subset of the SCL language. 

The language processor will process an SCL program. All tokens in this language are separated by white spaces. The parsing algorithm should detect any syntactical error. Each error discovered should cause an appropriate error message to be printed. Run-time errors should also be detected with appropriate error messages being printed.
